[OrgaMapper github pages](https://schmiedc.github.io/OrgaMapper/)<br/>
[OrgaMapper repository](https://github.com/schmiedc/OrgaMapper)

The R data processing and plotting is implemented as [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) App.
This allows you to read in the output data and execute the data processing using a graphical interface.
Summary plots are shown in the OrgaMapper Shiny App directly for user convenience.
